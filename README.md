Struggled a bit with pushing the project to github however i managed to do so eventually

First I opened visual studio code 
then I created a new folder within my MAST folder called Ice task
I then opened the terminal within visual studio code and entered "npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript" to create a blank project
I then changed the text to say "Hello, Daniel Prazeres!" and saved the project
I then opened up bluestacks as well as the "run for bluestacks" batch file
Once bluestacks had finished loading I went back into visual studio code to enter "npx expo start" and then "a" to run my app
once the app was running i took a picture 
Then I created this repository and pushed the project to it using git 
and then lastly wrote the readme file which you are reading right now and uploaded the picture of the app running within bluestacks
